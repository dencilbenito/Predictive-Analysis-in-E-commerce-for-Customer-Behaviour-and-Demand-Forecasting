    Due to today’s transition from visiting physical stores to online shopping, 
    predicting customer behaviour in the context of the e-commerce is gaining 
    importance. Predictive analytics to predict user intentions toward a specific 
    product or a category on an e-commerce website is very useful for demand 
    forecasting. Forecasting plays a very important role in the operations of 
    management. It is important and necessary aid to planning and planning is the 
    backbone of effective operations. This demand forecasting serves as the starting 
    point for many activities such as warehousing, shipping, price forecasting and 
    especially, supply planning that aims at fulfilling the demand and requires data 
    on the anticipated need of customers.<o:p></o:p></span><img alt="2"
